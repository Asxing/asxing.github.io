## 敏捷基本面

对于日常开发过程中，我们需要的一些能力：

- leadership 
- Collaborate 
- learn
- self-direct
- innovation
- respect
- trust



在敏捷中有两个关键点

- 一个是 courage
- 一个是 principle



敏捷原则：

- 有一个明确的目标
- 听、学习、反思不断正向迭代循环
- 鼓励自发激发创新



`The Standard value you walk past, is the standard value you accept. That goes for all of us, but especially those, who by their rank, have a leadership role.`

你过去取得的成就，前提是我们一起接受那个标准。

对于他人的信任，然后就是我们要表达自己的观点，表达冲突。
